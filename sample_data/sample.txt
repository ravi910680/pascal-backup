This is a short sample representing a few paragraphs from a non-fiction book.
It contains ideas about habits, decision-making, and cognitive biases.

Chapter 1: Habits
Habits are loops of cue, routine, and reward. They can be reshaped by changing the routine while keeping the cue and reward intact.

Chapter 2: Decisions
Decisions under uncertainty benefit from probabilistic thinking, small bets, and feedback loops. Avoid sunk-cost fallacy and outcome bias.

Chapter 3: Biases
Common biases include confirmation bias, availability bias, and anchoring. Counter them with checklists, pre-mortems, and diverse viewpoints.
